UI.Space.ProspectorEnRoute=Prospector Probe En Route
UI.Space.SitesTooltip=This list displays known data about the productivity of mining at the hab site(s) on this space body.<br/><br/>If the site has not been prospected, it displays our best estimate of monthly production of each type of space resource if mined at its maximum capacity.<br/><br/>If it has been prospected but not colonized, it displays the precise monthly output if the site had a basic mine.<br/><br/>Once a mine is built, it displays the actual mining output, which can increase above the baseline if large mines are operating here.
UI.Space.Population={0}{1}
UI.Space.AMAT=A value in the {0} column measures naturally occuring antimatter production per month at this location. High-energy cosmic rays bombarding planetary atmospheres can sometimes create antimatter particles that are captured by the planet's magnetic fields. Sufficiently advanced technologies may be able to harvest some of them, giving us a very small antimatter income.
UI.Space.OrbitInterface=This is an interface orbit, which is denoted by the planet icon. Fleets and stations in this orbit have additional opportunities to interact with the surface of the space body.
UI.Space.OrbitHazard={0} This orbit receives dangerous levels of naturally occuring radiation. Any hab module built here will have {1} times its normal mass to account for all the shielding necessary to protect fragile electronics and crew members.
UI.Space.HabSiteHazard={0} This site receives dangerous levels of naturally occuring radiation. Any hab module built here will have {1} times its normal mass to account for all the shielding necessary to protect fragile electronics and crew members.
UI.Space.Debris={0} This orbit has {1} dangerous cloud(s) of debris from space assets that have been destroyed here. Debris clouds present a hazard to undefended stations.
UI.Space.TimePenalty=The next date Earth will have an optimum launch window for a low Delta-v (Hohmann) transfer to {0} is {1}. Any probes, hab modules, and other items that use boost that are launched from Earth today will suffer a {2} penalty to the duration of flight, representing its wait for a launch window and/or longer flight time to reach the destination.<br/><br/>An {3} indicates the launch window is approaching and the penalty will decrease; an {4} indicates the launch window has recently passed and the penalty will increase before it begins to decrease again.	// space object name, date, value%, down green arrow icon, up green arrow icon
UI.Space.AlienTerritory=Because of the heavy alien presence here, we cannot safely found bases in this planetary system.
UI.Space.AlienTerritoryShort=We cannot probe or found bases here.
UI.Space.OrbitalPeriodTooltip=The orbital period of this space body, or how long it takes to travel around {0}.
UI.Space.MaxTier_SpaceBody=This space body is large enough to support up to Tier {0} habitats.
UI.Space.MaxTier_LagrangePoint=This Lagrange point can support up to Tier {0} stations.

UI.Space.SolarSummary_OrbitMany=Orbits around this body provide have a solar multiplier of between {0} and {1}. 
UI.Space.SolarSummary_OrbitOne=Orbits around this body provide have a solar multiplier of {0}.
UI.Space.SolarSummary_Orbit=<sp>The multiplier is a modifier to the output of any station solar module built here. The value decreases dramatically for space objects far the Sun.
UI.Space.SolarSummary_OrbitBody=<sp>The value will be higher for space objects far from their parent body as they are in the body's shadow less frequently.
UI.Space.SolarSummary_SitesMany=Hab sites on this body provide have a solar multiplier of between {0} and {1}. 
UI.Space.SolarSummary_SitesOne=Hab sites on this body provide have a solar multiplier of {0}.
UI.Space.SolarSummary_Sites=<sp>Hab site modifiers will usually be lower than orbital multipliers because most sites rotate away from the Sun.
