If we bid higher than they do, we avoid combat; if they bid more, we must fight them. The maximum bids are determined by the differences in the fleets' accelerations. Both sides will spend the lower of the two bids regardless of whether combat occurs.

UI.Precombat.ChaseMechanics=In a pursuit, the two fleets' relative accelerations determine how the chase will play out. If one fleet can significantly out-accelerate its opponent, it can force the engagement, or dodge it for little Delta-v. Two fleets with similar accelerations will engage in a slow stern chase, potentially spending a great deal of DV to resolve, if both sides commit to spending it.<br/><br/>The pursuit ends when the chasing fleet closes a distance of {0} times the maximum weapons targeting range of any ship in either fleet ({1} km), or the evading fleet extends the distance between to the two fleets by the same amount.<br/><br/>In some cases, the pursuing fleet may be able to break up in order to force combat. This will occur if some ships can catch the fleet, or the fleet is large enough to be able to surround the enemy fleet. 
UI.Precombat.ChaseMechanics_Fixed=In a pursuit, the two fleets' relative accelerations determine how the chase will play out. If one fleet can significantly out-accelerate its opponent, it can force the engagement, or dodge it for little Delta-v.
